= Appendix C3: Pre-Rolls

The electronic pre-rolls were lost to data transfer, but still exist on a downloadable PDF https://exp.sciencyfiction.com/_attachments/expgame.pdf[EXP 4.01 1993 (32M)].
There are many pre-rolled personas starting at game page 713 aka PDF page 727. 
There are many pre-rolled TOYs starting at game page 689 aka PDF page 703.
A cheezy scenario starts on game page 755 aka PDF page 769.

There is a collection of python programs at https://github.com/mobilehugh/EXP_Game_Tools[EXP Game Tools] that help decrease the crunchiness of persona creation in EXP. The tool set is pre-alpha, but can make PDFs of referee personas quite easily. The tool will also keep track of experience points and player persona info as well. You will need to install python and FPDF2 for the packages to work. There is an limited readme at the github page.
