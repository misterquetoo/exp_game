= Appendix B4: Sciency Fiction Shorts

IMPORTANT: *Welcome friend of EXP. You are in an unfinished section of EXP. Please excoriate.*

The rules for shorts getting here are entirely based on my preference. 
Live action only, CGI is wonderful, but this is for live action.

These are video holders for when Antora supports local videos. 
We could use YouTube, but why subject users to advertising for public domain content?
What would be best is when URLs can be used and these videos can stored on a CDN.
