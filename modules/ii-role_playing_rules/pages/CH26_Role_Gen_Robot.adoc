= Robot Fabrication

Robots are the colloquial name for the family Machinidae. 
Machinidae represents any life form that is inorganic and fabricated.
An organic fabricated life form would be an alien.
An inorganic non-fabricated life form would be a robot.
Anthros, aliens and robots fabricate robots.

== Robot Attributes
The standard attributes of EXP are present in all personas.
In the Role Playing System, players only record those attributes at which the persona excels.
A persona can have a blank attributes section and function fine.
Another persona may have the attribute intelligence. 

====
*Attributes:* INT
====

The persona's intelligence attribute is worth noting. 
A persona can excel at more than one attribute.

====
*Attributes:* INT, DEX
====

There is no score assigned to an attribute. 
The persona either excels at an attribute or not.
The attributes help the personas when they undertake maneuvers.
For example, a persona with STR would be better at lifting than a persona with INT.
When two personas have the same attribute, then no advantage is given.
If two personas grappling both had Strength, then neither gains an advantage.
However, if a persona with STR and DEX is grappling with a persona with just STR, they get a DEX advantage.

These advantages are called shifts and increase the chance of success with the 4D2 Mechanism.

Size::
Robots can have variable sizes. 
The robot type determines its size.
The player records her size descriptor on her persona record sheet.
The Role Playing System does not use wate in kgs.

Most Excellent Attribute::
The player rolls once to determine the most excellent attribute of her alien persona.

include::ROOT:partial$CH26_Table_Attribute.adoc[]

Awareness::
Awareness indicates how aware a persona is of her surroundings. 
It indicates how well is the persona's brain connects to the outside world. 
The attribute is a collective measure of the persona's sensors. 
AWE includes senses like hearing, vision, smell, touch and taste. 
Awareness does not include the sixth sense or a sense of style. 
The abbreviation for awareness is AWE.

Charisma::
Charisma is charm, looks and sociability all combined into one value. 
A high charisma represents a high proficiency at getting along with other personas. 
This attribute is universal, so any persona with a high CHA would be socially adept. 
A persona's charisma is crucial for inter-persona interactions.
The abbreviation for charisma is CHA.

Constitution::
Constitution represents a persona's internal physique.
CON is a combination of wellness, immunity, energy extraction, healing ability.
A high CON is better to repel disease, resist poisons, and repair damaged tissue.
The abbreviation for constitution is CON.

Dexterity::
Dexterity represents the connection between the brain and the outside world.
Agility, balance, eye-hand, reflexes and running speed are components of dexterity.
A high DEX person could run faster, dance better and quicker reflexes.
Dexterity would help the persona catch a priceless vase or dive through a closing door.
The abbreviation for dexterity is DEX.

Intelligence::
Intelligence indicates the smarts of the persona.
Elements of INT are memory, deduction, creativity, adaptability and their synergism. 
The higher the intelligence of the persona, the smarter she is.
The abbreviation for intelligence is INT.

Mind::
Mind exists as an attribute.
Players cannot roll Mind as a most excellent attribute.
Players acquire MND through a story set out by the referee.
The players will decide if the persona has earned the MND attribute.
The abbreviation for Mind is MND.

Strength::
Strength represents force the persona can generate to get work done. 
STR is a combination of leverage, power and physique. 
Strength determines how much the persona can lift or damage by brute force. 
STR helps kicking open doors, breaking bonds, or crushing beer bottles.
The abbreviation for Strength is STR.

Hit Points::
There are no hit points in the Role Playing System.
Combat and damage are both absolute and descriptive. 
There is no quantitative measure of well-being like 32 hit points out of 42.
Personas are damaged in combat by losing attributes, skills and abilities instead of hit points.
When the 4D2 Mechanic generates a Cataclysmic Failure, the persona can lose an attribute, skill or ability.
Extreme failures on the 4D2 Mechanic can mortally wound or kill the persona.
The abbreviation for hit points is HPS.

Social Standing::
There is no Social Standing in the Role Playing System.
The players must roleplay social interactions in the Role Playing System (go figure).
The abbreviation for social standing is SS.

EXPS and Level::
There are no Experience Points or Experience levels in the Role Playing System. 
Personas earn additional attributes, skills and abilities instead of experience points or levels.
The 4D2 Mechanic can generate new attributes, skills or abilities.
This process replaces experience points and experience levels.
The abbreviation for experience points is EXPS.

== Robot Type
The robot type determines its intended reason to be.
A robot type describes the primary function of the persona.
A heavy combot is a very different persona from a domestic janitorial robot.

In the Role Playing System, players use the Single Role Robot Type Table to determine their robot type.
The referee should massage the robot type to suit her campaign's milieu.
For example, is a first-level expedition ready for a heavy combot? 
Players can choose their robot type if that choice improves the story.

== Robot Mutations
Robots can get only get mutations if they have a peripheral or programming that functions like a mutation.

== Abilities and Skills
Robot abilities are hardware-based and can be called peripherals. 
Abilities are built into the robot and represent baked in hardware and devices.

Robot skills are software-based and can be called programming.
Skills are maneuvers programmed into the robot.
Robotic progammes can be erased or possibly transferred.

== Robot Abilities (peripherals)
Robot abilities are also called peripherals. 
Peripherals represent baked-in hardware that is part of the robot.
Peripherals require mechanical devices integrated with the robot.
Only direct damage to the robot's peripheral system can harm a robot's ability.

=== Peripheral Systems
Peripheral systems are two tables that endow the robot with additional devices and programmes. 
The peripherals parameter has several options.

None::
No roll on the Peripheral Systems Table.
Usually, it is security reasons that keep peripherals off a robot.

One:: 
One roll on the Primary Peripherals Table.

Two:: 
Two rolls on the Primary Peripherals Table.

Specific Peripherals::
Some robots automatically get specific peripherals in addition to or instead of a roll on the Peripherals Table.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Primary_Robotic_Peripherals.adoc[]

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Secondary_Peripherals.adoc[]

=== Defensive Systems
Defensive systems protect the robot from harm.
These are baked-in devices or programmes that protect the robot.

None::
No roll on the Defensive Systems Table.

One:: 
One roll on the Defensive Systems Table.

Two:: 
Two rolls on the Defensive Systems Table.

Specific Defences::
Some robots automatically get specific defences in addition to or instead of a roll on the Defensive Systems Table.

=== Offensive Systems
Offensive systems are baked-in devices or peripherals that the robot uses to inflict damage on targets.
The offensive system could be a bespoke weapon or misused peripheral.
All robots can ram themselves into targets to inflict damage.

None::
No roll on the Offensive Systems Tables.

None Ever::
None ever is a special case for robots that can never use offensive weapons.

One:: 
One roll on Attack Table One.

Two:: 
Two rolls on Attack Table One.

One on X::
One roll on the specified attack table.
For example, One on Two would be one roll on Attack Table Two.

== Robot Vocation
A vocation is a calling or innate skill set possessed by the persona.
If the referee's milieu indicates, a vocation could mean training at a school, institute or guild.
The player may choose from any of the listed vocations or pick one randomly.
Allowing the dice to choose the persona's vocation allows for attributes and abilities to be awarded.
For example, choosing a vet does not allow the persona to add CHA or choose one ability.
A randomly chosen spie would get the DEX attribute and be able to choose one ability.

include::ROOT:partial$CH26_Table_Role_Vocations.adoc[]

=== Vocation Attributes
Each vocation is associated with an attribute.
If the player generates her vocation randomly, her persona gets the designated attribute.
If the player randomly rolls a mercenary, her persona gets the vocation attribute STR added to her attribute list. 
If the player chooses a mercenary, her persona does not get the vocation attribute STR added to her attribute list. 

=== Vocation Abilities
Many vocations are associated with baked-in abilities.
Abilities are not skills.
Any persona can acquire a skill.
Abilities are part and parcel of the vocation.
A persona cannot learn the vet Quick Fix ability. 
If the player generates her persona vocation randomly, she can choose one vocation ability.

Biologist::
The biologist dedicates herself to studying the organic world.
These studies range from its denizens to its cultures.
The player can add AWE to her persona's attributes if she randomly chose this vocation.
Every biologist gets two xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH08_Vocations_Biologist.adoc#biologist_skills[biologist skills,window=_blank].

Knite::
The knite dedicates herself to promoting order, or chaos, by connecting the Physical and Think Spaces. 
A player cannot choose or randomly generate the vocation knite.
Before a persona can become a knite, she must first earn her MND attribute.
A persona can earn the Knite vocation by completing a Knite qualification storyline laid out by the players.
The players will decide if the persona has earned the Knite vocation.
For more detail about knites jump to xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH08_Vocations_Knite.adoc[knites,window=_blank].

Robots can lose programmes in the event of cataclysmic failures. 

== Robot Artifacts

It is entirely random, and the player only makes one roll. 
The result can range from random junque to starcruiser.
