= Software 

This is the soft stuff that supports the hardware. 
The software section includes elements like appearance, colour, tech level and batteries.
Nothing in software is essential, but most things in software are fun.

Appearance fleshes out the artifact making it distinctive from other artifacts.
The support equipment is the hardware that keeps the identified artifacts running.
The space ships need fuel, the lazer pistol needs batteries, and the computers need programmes.
