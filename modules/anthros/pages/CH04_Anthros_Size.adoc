= Anthro Size

Anthros are human-sized.
In the vernacular of EXP, anthros are medium-sized. 
The occasional ursidae anthro may sneak onto the bottom of the large scale.
Only alien and robot personas can be tiny or gigantic.
Size has two components, hite and wate. 
Hite, aka height, is the persona's length in centimetres.
Wate, aka weight, is the persona's volume/mass in kilograms.

== Hite
The player calculates her persona's hite by referencing her anthro type's hite data.
Each anthro type has an average hite and a hite variation.

The player rolls the hite variation described for her chosen anthro size.
Next, the player adds the hite variation to her anthro type's base hite.
The hite variation can be positive or negative, generating a hite above or below the average.
The following example shows how to generate an ursidae anthro's hite.

=== Calculate Anthro Hite
.anthro hite = average hite + hite variation
****
The average hite is 176 cm. If hite variation is +10 cm she is 186 cm tall. 
If the hite variation is -15 cm, she is 161 cm tall.
****

== Wate 
The persona's wate is proportional to her hite.
The taller she is, the greater her wate.
The wate of the persona is a pure calculation based on the hite of the persona.
The greater the hite of the persona, the greater her wate. 

There are no rolls made when generating a persona wate.
The player finds her persona's average wate.
The player calculates her persona's wate variation.
The player calculates her wate variation by dividing her hite by her average hite. 
The player multiplies her average wate by wate variation.
The following example shows how to calculate an ursidae's wate.

=== Calculate Wate Variation
.wate variation  = persona hite / average hite
****
The persona's average hite is 176 cm. If her hite is 186 cm, she has a wate variation of 1.05. If her hite is 161 cm, she has a hite variation of 0.91.
****

=== Calculate Anthro Wate
.anthro wate = average wate * wate variation
****
The base wate is 78 kg.  A 1.05 wate variation yields an 82 kg anthro. A 0.91 wate variation yields a 71 kg anthro.
****

The player records the final hite and final wate on her persona record. 
She also wonders if it was worth all the arithmetic work.
Smiling, she remembers that numeracy is an excellent skill.
