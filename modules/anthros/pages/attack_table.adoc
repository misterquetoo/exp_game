= Anthro Attack Table

The combat rules in the Roll Playing System employs an attack matrix called the attack table.
The player refers to the attack table every time she makes an attack roll.
Following are the details of how to calculate an attack table for an anthro persona.

The anthro attack table includes the persona's vocation in it's calculation.
Sometimes the anthro attack table will be referred to as a vocation attack table.
Alien and robot personas have their own unique attack tables, which do not include vocation data. 
If an alien or robot persona has a vocation it is possible that she may use this vocation based attack table.

== Skilled Bonus
The Skilled Bonus (Skilled) is for weapons in which the persona is skilled.
The player adds the Skilled to her attack roll when her persona uses a weapon in which she is proficient.
The Skilled has two main components: Attributes Bonus and Level bonus.
The persona's Skilled increases as the persona gains EXPS levels. 

=== Attribute Component
The persona's attributes determine the majority of the persona's Skilled Bonus.
Strong personas wield crushing weapons well.
Dextrous personas wield projectile weapons well.
If a persona's attributes increase or decrease, the player should recalculate her attack table.

=== Level Component
The persona's vocation determines her level bonus.
Each vocation has its level bonus.r attack roll.
This reduction of her Skilled depends on her vocation and weapon type.
The Raw Bonus Table numbers are percentages that the player multiplies the Skilled by.
A nomad with a 100 Skilled would have a 25 Raw for her unskilled weapons.

== Raw Bonus
The Raw Bonus (Raw) is not a wrestling thang.
A persona's Raw Bonus represents the persona's raw attribute abilities.
Usually this is reserved for Weapons that the persona is not skilled with.
