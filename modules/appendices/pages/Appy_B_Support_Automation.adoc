== EXP Specific
There are two EXP specific tools available.
They both live on github. 
The Rule Site Builder allows dev savvy folks to create a local HTML copy of EXP using https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/[Antoradocs].

The Persona Generator is a python application that will help create personas and referee personas for Anthros and Aliens
You must have https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python] on your machine and like text/PDF outputs.

== Plague Years (2020-2021)
During the plague years many many new virtual table tops and online aids came into being. 
Our table became a network and we used  the following configuration. 
This configuration is no longer suitable and hopefully we will get things sorted by the next plague.

== Post Plague Playability (2023 onwards)
If you are Roll Playing and you are going tactical there really isn't much.
The computer supports that allows complex die rolls don't have hexes or vice versa.
If you are Role Playing and the theatrical system is all you need there really isn't very much.
Turns out it is surprisingly hard to get the 4d2 Mechanic to work. 
Below is list of table tops and what to expect.

.*These should work*

* https://roll20.net[Roll20 - For their cash!]
* https://www.rptools.net/[RPTools - For the FOSS!]


== EXP Compatibility Table
Face it, I just like making asciidoc tables. 

.*Legend*
* Link - click to activate hypertext anchor magic.
* Dice - Yes = can do kilodie and 4D2 dice rolls.
* Map - Yes = can do hexagons on maps.
* Snark - what I think. FOSS = Free and Open Source Stuff.
