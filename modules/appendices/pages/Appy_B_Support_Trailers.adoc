= Appendix B3: Sciency Fiction Trailers

IMPORTANT: *Welcome friend of EXP. You are in an unfinished section of EXP. Please promulgate.*

The rules for trailers getting here are entirely based on my preference. 
Live action movies only, no superhero movies, no CGI.

These are video holders for when Antora supports local videos. 
We could use YouTube, but why subject users to advertising for public domain content?
What would be best is when URLs can be used and these videos can stored on a CDN.
