= Random Junque

The title of this chapter is self explanatory.
The tables contained in here are filled with lists of completely useless equipment.
It is almost certain that these artifacts have existed in every society in one form or another.
Random junque is useless equipment when compared to the artifacts created by TOYs.
However players regularly find use for random junque during their sessions. 

Random junque should not count as a roll for players generating start up Toys.

Wate::
If a random junque needs a wate the players decide whether it is large or small.
Small items are 100 grams and large items are 10kg. 

EXPS::
Players should earn decent EXPS if they manage to use random junque in their game session.
The EXPS earned usually ends in 42, and ranges from 42 to 1042 experience points.

Value::
Random junque has a random resale value of 1-10 (1d10) eps.
There is also a 10% chance that sacrificing a piece of random junque will generate a spare part.
A spare part can be used to fix a more objectively useful artifact.
