= Exatmo Vehicle Combat Damage

Here are the details for how space vessels break down in combat. 
Damage Report!

== Space Vehicle Damage
When an attack is successful, the ship suffers damage.
There are many roads to a successful attack.
The player can win an attack roll by beating the target's Defence Rating.
The player can win a percentage roll by beating the target roll.

Space vehicles do not have hit points.
Whenever a ship is damaged, the successful attacker rolls both a hit location and extent of damage.
However, the HPS damage rolled for an attack is important.

.*Breaking Down Space Ship Breaking*
. A successful attack
. Damage Location
. Damage Severity
. Damage Effect

Damage to the interior of the ship does not necessarily indicate hull damage.
Power surges, from one point to another, can also account for random damage locations.
Keep in mind the Life Support Protective Onion when inflicting damage on space vehicles.

include::combat:partial$life_support_onion.adoc[]

== Damage Location
Damage location indicates which of the space vehicle's systems is targeted by an attack.
Damage location in space vehicle combat is entirely random.
The damage location is random because of space vehicle diversity, the chaos of combat maneuvers, and mystery juice.
Space vehicle damage is similar to damage location for robots and vehicles.
Every successful attack generates a random damage location.

The damage location is not the same as a hit location. 
Power surges, electric disruptions, shields, and ship structure send damage anywhere in the vehicle.
Even a space vehicle that is immobilized cannot have damage locations chosen.
Automatic hitting does not affect damage location.

include::combat:partial$exatmo_vehicle_damage_location.adoc[]

=== Location Not Found
A space vehicle may not have the damage location rolled.
The damage location may have never existed on the space vehicle.
For example, a space vehicle may not have a special drive damage location.

There are several approaches to missing damage locations.
The player can simply roll again to find a different damage location. 
The referee can move the damage location within the general damage location.
For example, a hit on the special drives becomes a hit on the exatmo drives.

In the case of a previously destroyed location, the attack falls on useless space junk. 
A system is destroyed when its function is <1%. 

== Damage Extent
The Extent of Damage Table determines how badly the system is damaged.
Space vehicle weapons inflict damage in HPS, but space vehicles do not have hit points.
Damage inflicts a decrease in function to the location.
The extent of damage roll reduces the performance of onboard equipment. 
If an exatmo drive is reduced by 50% functionality, the space vehicle loses half its speed and range. 
If the exatmo drive is damaged by 50% again, the new functionality would be 25% fully operational. 
For example, an exatmo drive level of 8 would be reduced to 4 by 50% damage and then to 2 by another 50% damage.

include::combat:partial$exatmo_vehicle_damage_amount.adoc[]

=== Force Bonus
Force Bonus is an optional rule that increases the severity of damage by hit points of damage. 
Each hit point of damage increases the extent of damage by one percent.
An attack inflicting 30 HPS of damage adds 30 to the extent of damage roll.
If a player rolls 55 on the extent of damage table and inflicts 30 hit points of damage, the final roll is 85. 
The 30 hit points increased the extent of damage from minor to major.
When using this damage adjuster, space weapons become way more destructive.
The players may prefer to adjust the Force Bonus to one percent per 5 hit points of damage.
Your space milage may vary.

TIP: Rules maintain game balance and assist creativity. +
*Do not let rules get in the way of the story or the fun.*

=== Cumulative Destruction
The damaging effects of successful attacks are cumulative.
A space vehicle system can be disabled over several attacks.
A system taking major damage (60% performance) twice has a 36% level of function. 
If the already damaged system suffered a critical blow (30% performance), it would drop to 11%.
A level 10 computer would be functioning as a level one computer. 
A level 5 exatmo drive would be functioning as a level one drive. 
Any further damage would decrease the system's performance to less than 10%.
A system is disabled when it is less than 10% functional.

.*Example Cumulative Damage*
. Undamaged 100% function
. Major Damage 60% function
. Major Damage 36% function
. Critical Damage 10% function
. Minor Damage 9% function - disabled

=== Instantaneous Destruction
Instantaneous destruction occurs when an attack destroys a system in a single blow.
Naval artillery, mine or missile may have hit the location.
The attack must drop the system from 100% to <1% function in a single attack.

The effects of instantaneous destruction are cataclysmic.
A destroyed hull would explosively decompress, a destroyed drive will melt down, fuel could explode, etc.
There is no chance for repair, and a replacement system will be required.

=== Damage Descriptors
Each time a system is damaged, its performance decreases. 
The damage descriptors offer another way to describe net damage.
A system with minor damage is more than 90% functional.
A disabled system is less than 10% functional.

include::ROOT:partial$CH38_Table_Extent_Damage_Descriptor.adoc[]

== Hull Damage
The hull is an integral component of the life support and gravity systems.
The hull helps contain the atmosphere generated by the life support system.
The hull also acts as the substrate for the gravity system.
Hull, life support and gravity are intimately integrated.

=== Hull as Armour
The hull cannot take damage until the ship's Armour (Hull AR) has been disabled.
The armour ratings of hulls are very high. 
The average Defence Rating of a space vehicle's hull is 1100.

The Defence Rating of the hull decreases as it takes damage.
If a mini-mine explodes against the hull and delivers 75 HPS of damage, the hull Defence Rating decreases by 75.
The hull Defence Rating can absorb massive amounts of damage, protecting the systems below. 

Reducing the Defence Rating to 420 disables the Defence Rating of the hull.
Disabling the Defence Rating allows damage to pass directly to the hull or the contents below it.
The Hull AR cannot drop below 420.

include::combat:partial$life_support_onion.adoc[]

=== Hull Compromise
Hull only becomes a damage location once the Hull Defence Rating is exhausted.
The hull begins to fail like any other system on the space vehicle.
The hull is disabled once the level of function drops below 10%.
The hull is destroyed once the level of function drops below 1%.

When the hull has been disabled or destroyed, further hull damage applies to another ship system.
If a player rolls a disabled hull as her damage location, she must roll again to determine which system is affected.
For example, she could hit the exatmo drives through the compromised hull.

A disabled hull (<10%) represents a manageable escape of its inatmo contents.
A destroyed hull (<1%) represents an unmanageable escape of its inatmo contents.
Both of these hull compromises allow for usual evacuation procedures for the area.
Instantaneous destruction (<1% in one attack) represents explosive decompression.
Explosive decompression is lethal to personas and equipment in the damaged location.

The ship can partition off a damaged location using its automated bulkheads.
Naval architecture does not recommend open-concept space vehicles.
The personas can repair a disabled hull during combat.
Life support and gravity systems will replenish repaired hull locations.
Repairing a hull section does not restore its Defence Rating.
The personas cannot repair a destroyed hull during combat.

== Drive Damage
Drives are the whole point of the space vehicle.
The higher the drive level, the better the space vehicle.
The extent of damage inflicted reduces drive levels.
If a level 10 exatmo takes major damage (40% reduction), it becomes a level 6 drive.
Drive damage is cumulative. 

=== Inatmo Drive Damage
Reduce the drive level of the in atmosphere drive by the percentage indicated.
This system is disabled when its level of function is less than 10%.
A ship with a disabled inatmo drive cannot maneuver in the atmosphere of a planet.
The pilot may beach the ship planetside or remain in orbit until repaired.

=== Exatmo Drive Damage
A damaged exatmo drive will have its drive level reduced by the percentage indicated.
Exatmo drives are disabled when their function is <10%.
The exatmo drives are the ship's combat drives.
Without exatmo drives, it cannot maintain combat spin.
When disabled, the ship drops out of combat and starts floating towards the nearest star.
Disabling the exatmo drives is a victory condition.

Exatmo drives power defence shields, active defences, and boarding evasion.
Damage to the exatmo drives also impairs these ancillary functions.
Exatmo drives are not affected by exposure exatmo. 
However, personas running the drives can be.

=== Special Drive Damage
Reduce the drive level of the special drive by the percentage indicated.
A disabled special drive keeps the space vehicle from making any long voyages.
Special drives are so delicate they resemble a life form. 
Exatmo is very unhealthy for a special drive.

== Fuel Damage
Damage to the fuel system represents the drive's inability to access the necessary fuel to function.
Disabling fuel systems can disable a particular drive or all drives. 
Sometimes the fuel itself is destroyed or lost in space.
Other times the fuel is still present but cannot be accessed.
During combat, there is no difference.

When a specific fuel system is disabled or destroyed, then that specific __drive__ is disabled.
A fuel system will continue to deliver adequate fuel for the drive to function until it is disabled.
The drive is not damaged, but it cannot work without fuel.
In the case of exatmo drives, this is a victory condition.

=== Amount Damage
The space vehicle's total fuel storage is damaged.
Fuel storage damage indicates a loss of actual fuel
The global fuel loss is non-denominational as all drives access the same fuel type.
If the Fuel Amount is damaged, reduced by 40%, all drives have less fuel to burn.
Inatmo, exatmo and special drives become choked for fuel.
Decreasing fuel amount indicates fuel is lost to space or destroyed.
Personas cannot repair fuel amounts lost.

A ship with ten months of fuel takes major damage (40%), reducing the fuel amount to six months.
The special drive can now only make six jumps.
Most importantly, the amount of fuel available for combat maneuvers decreases.
Combat maneuvers burn fuel at the rate of one week per turn of space vehicle combat.
So the space vehicle can now only fuel 24 turns of space combat before dropping out.
Running out of fuel for combat is a victory condition.

=== Consumption Damage
Consumption damage impairs the system that divides fuel between the drives.
The fuel is intact, the drives are intact, and the fuel system is intact.
All fuel systems drop by the extent of damage, but no fuel is lost.
Unless destroyed in combat, the consumption system is repairable.

== Computer Damage
The computer is the space vehicle, and the space vehicle is the computer.
The ship's computer is the most important and most delicate system on the space vehicle.
Computer damage impairs nearly every function of the space vehicle.
If a level 6 computer suffers 40% damage, it becomes a level 2 computer.
ECM, boarding, defences, ramming, targeting are all impaired by this decrease in function. 

A disabled ship's computer puts everything into a non-functional hibernation state. 
Personas may try to operate a ship with a disabled computer manually.
Usually, a destroyed ship's computer leads to an immobilized hulk drifting towards the nearest star.

The ship's computer is not part of the life support onion.
Gravity and life support remain operational in the face of a disabled or destroyed ship's computer.

=== Robot Control Damage
The ship's robots cease to function or follow the computer's commands.
The computer loses control of robots by the percentage indicated.
The ship's control over the robot is damaged. 
The robot is not damaged at all.
Robots will perform gunnery skills, or veterinary care, at a reduced skill level.
Mechanics can try and get the robots functioning through priority commands or robot overrides.

If robot control is disabled or destroyed, the robots stop functioning altogether.
It would be more fun the robots acquired free will with their newfound freedom.
Robot self-awareness could range from irritating behaviours to a well-deserved robot mutiny.

=== Software Damage
While the computer level remains intact, its software loses function.
Ship software has both hardware and software components representing a tight integration with the ship. 

The decrease in function is not only programming data but essential peripherals and sensors as well.
Software damage does not affect the computer level or ECM.
Only the extra software packages are damaged.
For example, crew replacement software damage may remove the ship's galley and cook.
The software packages can be reduced in effectiveness or simply disabled.
Players should be able to choose which software packages are lost.
They may wish to preserve astrogation or gunnery over the entertainment system.

== Cargo Damage
The cargo hold and any elements related to cargo are damaged.
Cargo elements include storage capacity, contents, airlocks, cargo locks and more.
Contents include any cargo or personas in the cargo bay.

Major (decrease by 40%) damage from an attack delivering 42 HPS in damage hits the cargo bay.
The cargo airlock can only open to 60% of the previous opening.
All personas in the cargo area would take 42 HPS in damage. 
The damage would reduce the value of the Profulcinating Hygromodulators (TM) to 60% of previous. 

== Crew Damage
Crew damage is the most dangerous of all the damage locations.
Crew damage includes the crew's quarters and all crew presently within it.
Crew damage is the expedition killer of space vehicle combat.

Apart from the hapless crew in their quarters, the decrease in function reduces berths, food production, hygiene facilities, and entertainment.
For example, the number of televid channels may decrease from 100 to a mere 60.

== Defence Damage
Damage to defences reduces the effectiveness of the defensive system by the percentage indicated.
The defences decrease in effectiveness the same as any other damaged system.

=== Life Support Onion
Before damaging life support, the outer layers of the onion must be disabled or destroyed.
The outermost layer of the onion is the ship's shields. 
If the ship does not have shields, the outermost layer of the onion is the hull Defence Rating.
The hull Defence Rating must fail before the hull can be damaged.
The hull must fail before gravity control can be damaged.
Gravity control must fail before life support can be damaged.

include::combat:partial$life_support_onion.adoc[]

=== Life Support Damage
Life support keeps the personas comfy and alive within the spaceship.
Life support does not appear on the damage location table.
Life support is the most critical defence on a space vehicle.
Attacks cannot damage life support without first peeling back the life support onion.
A space vehicle must lose its shields, hull armour, hull and gravity before attacks can damage life support.
Attacks must destroy gravity control before life support is vulnerable.
Life support suffers damage the same as any other system once the onion is disabled.

=== Gravity Control Damage
Gravity control maintains life-saving, plot convenient gravity throughout the space vehicle.
Gravity cannot be damaged before the ship's hull is disabled.
Until the hull is disabled, the damage location of gravity control moves to the highest level of the life support onion.

The effectiveness of gravity control drops by the percentage indicated by the extent of damage roll.
Ineffective gravity control can lead to inconvenient ZOG, space sickness, and difficulty performing tasks.
If gravity control drops to less than 30%, the ship cannot safely make combat maneuvers.
Losing gravity is a victory condition.

=== Hull Defence Rating Damage
The hull Defence Rating represents the hardening of the space ship's hull to prevent combat damage.
Hull Defence Rating is part of the life support onion, and unless the space vehicle has shields, hull armour is the outermost layer.
Until the shields are disabled, the damage location of hull armour moves to the ship's shields.

NOTE: *Hull AR, Armour, and Defence Rating are interchangeable and separate from Hull.*

Defence Rating is an amalgam of many factors. 
Structurally it includes hull strength, combat hardening, and combat alterations.
Tactically is includes the ship's computer, ECM and drives.

==== Calculating Armour Damage
Sadly there are two ways to calculate the extent of damage to the Defence Rating.
The first simply uses the standard extent of damage drop in effectiveness.
An 800 Defence Rating that takes major damage (40% damage) drops to 480.
The lowest a space vehicle's Defence Rating can get is 420.
Once the Defence Rating is 420, the hull is vulnerable to attack.

The second is more complicated but allows Defence Rating to last a bit longer.
The drop in efficiency only affects the portion of the Defence Rating that is above 400.
An 800 Defence Rating would only drop the efficiency of the top 400 points of Defence Rating.
So a vessel with an Defence Rating of 800 taking major damage would have a new AR of 640.
Once the Defence Rating is 420, the hull is vulnerable to attack.

=== Defencive ECM Damage
Defensive ECM becomes reduced by the percentage indicated by the extent of damage.
ECM is a bit more resilient than other space vehicle systems.
Damaged defensive ECM can still function fully as attack ECM.
If the space vessel has two ECM systems, the attack ECM can replace the damaged defensive ECM, and the defence ECM can replace the damaged attack ECM.

=== Shield Damage 
Shields are the technomagical standard that indicates the health of a space vehicle.
The shields' effectiveness drops by the percentage indicated on the extent of damage roll.
Shields are immune to damage bonuses on the Extent of Damage Table.
If a shield could absorb 400 HPS damage and has sustained major damage (60%), it would only be able to absorb 240 HPS per attack until repaired.
The shield is disabled at <10% of capacity, and attacks on the shield move to the Hull AR.

=== Gun Damage
Gun damage represents damage to the airlock defence guns.
The gun's range and damage drop by the extent of damage indicated.
So an airlock gun that sustained major damage (40% damage) would have its range reduced by 60%, and each damage roll reduced by 60%.
A gun with a range of 100 hexes would now have a range of 60 hexes.
Every damage roll would be multiplied by 0.6.
A disabled gun stops working.

=== Active Damage
Active defences can look after themselves.
The active defence will get one chance to stop an attack from damaging the active defence system.
This active self-defence is an automatic counterattack regardless of recent activity.
Depleted active defences cannot defend themselves.
The active defence has its effectiveness reduced by the percentage indicated by the extent of damage.

== Attack Damage


=== Attack ECM Damage
Attack ECM effectiveness drops by the percentage indicated by the extent of damage.

=== Ramming Damage
Ramming success drops by the percentage indicated by the extent of damage.
The physical plant, sensors, and machinery of ramming become damaged.

Calculating this reduction in ramming effectiveness is a pain in the butt.
The player must make a successful pilot roll for a successful ramming attack.
Does one reduce the player's die roll by the extent of damage?
Does one increase the value that the player needs to beat?
Since ramming is such a blunt instrument, this referee prefers to ignore the graduated drop.
Ramming is either working or disabled. 

If the Ramming system is disabled, this space vehicle may no longer ram.
A space vehicle with disabled ramming capacity may still use the Boarding attack.

=== Artillery Damage
The artillery drops its range, and HPS damage by the extent of damage indicated.
Major damage drops the artillery to 60% of its previous effectiveness.
The artillery's range decreases from 500 to 300 hexes.
The artillery's area of effect decreases from 20 to 12 hexes.
Every damage roll would be multiplied by 0.6.
Disabled artillery stops working.

Instantaneously destroyed (reduced to <1% in one attack), artillery may explode inside the space vehicle.
Whether the artillery battery explodes in the ship or not should be decided by plot and sphincter dice.
An artillery explosion inside the ship delivers one location damage roll to the ship.

=== Boarding Damage
Boarding success drops by the percentage indicated by the extent of damage.
The physical plant, sensors, and machinery of ramming become damaged.

Calculating the reduction in boarding effectiveness is a pain in the butt.
The player must make a successful pilot roll for a successful boarding attack.
Does one reduce the player's die roll by the extent of damage?
Does one increase the target roll that the player needs to beat?
Often it is easier just to accept boarding is either operational or disabled. 

If the Boarding system is disabled, this space vehicle may no longer board.
A space vehicle with a disabled boarding capacity may still use the Ramming attack.

=== Grenades Damage
The number of grenade attacks drops by the amount indicated by the extent of damage.
This reduction in function impacts both mini-missiles and mini-mines.
The damage impairs the guidance systems and connectivity to the ship's computer.

The extent of damage decreases the number of mini-missiles and mini-mines deployable per turn. 
For example, a grenade system reduced to 60% could only drop six mini-mines instead of 10.

Instantaneously destroyed (reduced to <1% in one attack), grenades may explode inside the space vehicle.
Whether the grenade system explodes in the ship or not should be decided by plot and sphincter dice.
A grenade detonation inside the ship delivers one location damage roll to the ship.

=== Bombs Damage
The number of bomb attacks drops by the amount indicated by the extent of damage.
This reduction in function impacts both naval missiles and naval mines.
The damage impairs the guidance systems and connectivity to the ship's computer.

The extent of damage decreases the number of missiles and mines deployable per turn. 
For example, a bomb system reduced to 60% could only drop six mines instead of 10.

Instantaneously destroyed (reduced to <1% in one attack), bomb systems may explode inside the space vehicle.
Whether the bomb system explodes in the ship or not should be decided by plot and sphincter dice.
A bomb detonation inside the ship delivers two location damage rolls to the vessel.

The bomb delivery system is hardened for combat and is difficult to destroy.
There are no damage bonuses awarded on the Extent of Damage Table for the bomb delivery system.

=== Naval Artillery Damage
The naval artillery drops its range, and HPS damage by the extent of damage indicated.
Major damage drops naval artillery to 60% of its previous effectiveness.
The artillery's range decreases from 15000 to 9000 hexes.
The artillery's area of effect decreases from 200 to 120 hexes.
Every damage roll would be multiplied by 0.6.
Disabled artillery stops working.

Instantaneously destroyed naval artillery may explode inside the space vehicle.
Accidental detonation depends on the plot and Sphincter Dice.
Detonated naval artillery will inflict three damage rolls on itself.

The naval artillery system is hardened for combat and is difficult to destroy.
There are no damage bonuses awarded on the Extent of Damage Table for naval artillery.

== Ref's Own Table
The referee can use this opportunity to infuse drama and excitement into the campaign.
It is generally considered bad form to annihilate an expedition using the ref's own table.
Subjecting the personas to comedic or dramatic challenges that lead to their demise is fair game.

== Personas and Damage
Exatmo space vehicle combat is lethal.
Personas are fleas perched on battling elephants, squashable at any moment.
Players must be aware that space vehicle combat can kill personas in an instant.
Personas caught in damaged locations will undoubtedly feel the ship's pain as well.
Minor damage to a space vehicle may be lethal to the anthros, aliens and robots housed in the damaged location.
Nothing personas showering in the crew quarters are at risk of damage.
Mechanics working on the drives are at risk of damage.

Hull penetration is not the cause of persona damage.
Destructive forces are communicated into the damage location by shock waves, debris, and energy leaks. 
Most persona damage is delivered when they throw themselves around as the camera shakes.

Damage from a bomb or naval artillery will certainly annihilate any persona caught in the hit location.
A direct hit from naval artillery to the crew's quarters would end up in every persona dead.
As the hull armour deteriorates, the risk to crew members increases.

=== Persona Damage Mitigation by Hull Armour
.HPS Damage = Attack HPS - (Hull AR / 10)
****
110 HPS of damage against a Hull AR of 800 would deliver 30 HPS of damage to personas.
****

== Damage Reports
The ship's computer generates damage reports about the space vehicle's system.
For an accurate damage report, the ship must have intact defensive ECM or a specialized program.
ECM attacks can deceive a ship's computer to give false damage reports.
Without automated damage reports, personas need to run around the ship, figuring ship damage themselves.
They may notice that the exatmo drives suck or that the computer is now dumber.

To gather any damage report info from an opponent requires a successful attack ECM probe.
Some referees will keep all space vehicle damage behind the screen and only letting players know a bit.
Other groups will have the players keeping track of their own vessel's demise.
