= Alien Pre Rolls

The alien pre rolls have been ported over from the version 4 PDF.
They had to be moved by hand as the optical character recognition could not make sense of the pdfs.
There are many discrepancies between the handbombed web renditions of the pre rolls and the pdfs.
The pdfs use an older version of attack table calculation and nomenclature. 
There are many fun tidbits of personality on the pdfs that did not make it over to the web version.
