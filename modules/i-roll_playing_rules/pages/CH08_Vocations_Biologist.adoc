Biologists are personas with a deep interest in the organic physical world's workings.
A biologist has broad interests in taxonomy, culture and research.
Their interests range from creepy crawly bugs to complicated economic systems. 
The vocation is broad as the organic world. 
Biologists are more interested in studying the organic world than repairing the organic world.
Biologists are more interested in organic systems than mechanical systems.
Vets, mechanics and biologists work well on research teams together. 

Biologists do not have degrees or diplomas or certificates from training programs.
They are self-taught, and their knowledge base is haphazard.
Their knowledge comes from keen observation, gardening books, environmental leaflets, nature shows, sagely advisors, and personal experience.

== Biologist Performance Rolls 
A Performance Rolls is made every time the biologist attempts a procedure.
An example procedure could be to identify if an alien is poisonous.
The procedure is assigned a degree of difficulty (DD).
The chance of success is improved the biologist's more skills with the biologist can use with the performance roll.

== Biologist Abilities
The biologist's abilities cover all aspects of the organic world.
Anything to do with organic life, anthros and aliens, falls under her purvey. 
This includes the observation, discovery, and identification of aliens. 
Biology covers the knowledge spheres of sociology, ecology, culture studies, and more.
A biologist's abilities do not include robots (mechanic) or organic repairs (veterinarian). 
However a biologist could take skills from the mechanic or veterinarian vocation.

Biologist abilties are divided into knacks (gifts), interests, and skills.

=== Knacks 
Biologist knacks (gifts) are the hard wired abilities that probably lead to the persona pursuing the biologist vocation. The biologist starts with the first knack and gets a new one every three EXPS levels.
Knacks are not transferrable between vocations and a player cannot choose a knack.

include::ROOT:partials$CH08_Table_Biologist_Knacks.adoc[]

=== Interests
Biologist interests are broad areas of that cover a wide swath of the organic world.
The interests are: Culture, Research and Taxonomy.
Any task  that falls under an interest gets the interest bonus on the task roll.
The Culture interest will help with any linguistic task.
The Research interest will help with any laboratory task.
The Taxonomy interest will help with any alien identification task.


NOTE: Skills help the biologist win a task roll. A skill is not required to attempt a task.

At startup, the persona gets one interest per three points of intelligence score.
A persona with a 12 INT would get three rolls on the Biologist Interest Table. 
After start up the persona earns another intereset with each new experience level.
The player can choose to roll on the Biologist Interest Table, or choose a specific interest

.*Example Three Rolls*
. Taxonomy 
** Herbivores, Desert Biome
. Taxonomy
** Detritivores, Desert Biome
.Culture
** Languages, Verbal

Streams and focuses are cumulative and separated.
The persona has two taxonomy streams, and the player can use them both on anything related to taxonomy.
Even if the persona has no chaser/hunter behaviour skills, she will use taxonomy 2 when working out chaser/hunter behaviour.
When figuring out something about herbivores, she will get a total bonus of 3 (taxonomy 2 and herbivore 1).
When studying a herbivore in a desert biome, she will get a total bonus of 5  (taxonomy 2, herbivore 1 and desert biome 2).
This skill layout has no research stream, and researching anthro genetics would get a bonus of 0.

.*Reorganized Skills*
* Taxonomy - 2 
** Desert Biome - 2
** Herbivores - 1
** Detritivores - 1
* Culture - 1
** Languages, Verbal - 1

== Biologist Streams
The skill streams are broad.
Any procedure that falls under a stream gets the stream bonus on the performance roll.
The Taxonomy Stream will help with any alien identification procedures.
The Culture Stream will help with any linguistic procedures.
The Research Stream will help with any laboratory procedures.

Each skill stream the biologist has includes an area of focus.
Her Taxonomy Skill Stream can focus on Herbivores in Desert Biome. 
Her Culture Stream can focus on verbal languages. 
Her Research Stream can focus on genetics.
The Focus Skills are less broad.
The biologist can use her Taxonomy Stream to identify an alien, but she could only use her focus if the alien is a herbivore.

=== Taxonomy Stream
Taxonomy is about identifying and categorizing organic species.
The Taxonomy Stream is the classic biologist as a naturalist.
Identifying finches on remote islands can upturn a whole society.
The player rolls a Taxonomy Focus Skill and a Biome for that Focus Skill.
A Taxonomy Stream roll would look like this: Taxonomy - Herbivore - Desert Biome.
The only stream that gets a biome skill is the Taxonomy Stream.

=== Research Stream
The Research Stream includes laboratory, invention and extension skills for the biologist.
Procedures like cloning, immunology, and antitoxin creation are Focus Skills from the Research Stream.

include::ROOT:partial$CH08_Table_Biologist_Research_Stream.adoc[]

=== Culture Stream
The Culture Stream involves any skills that represent the interaction of a population.
Understanding languages, family structures, and political nuance are Focus Skills from the Culture Stream.

== Biologist EXPS
The benefits of increasing experience levels are more skills, improved performance, and marginally better combat skills.
Biologists earn experience points for completing procedures and role-playing within their vocation.
Only 20% of combat experience can go towards a biologist's experience point total.

// tag::biologist_maneuvers[]
== Biologist Maneuvers
Biologist maneuvers involve anything organic that does not involve healing.
Most biologist maneuvers are knowledge based unless an obvious physical procedure is involved.
Knowledge based maneuvers can grant the player an INT Performance Roll bonus.

The minimal equipment required by a biologist is her notebooks. 
The referee may make a target roll more difficult if the biologist does not have her notebooks.
