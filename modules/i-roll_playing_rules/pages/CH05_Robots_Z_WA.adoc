Wate Allowance is the amount of wate that a persona can lift.

Don't let rules get in the way of the fun.
Robots are affected by encumbrance similar to other personas.

The robot persona's wate allowance depends on both her Strength prime and her Strength score. 
Wate allowance is one area where robots have an advantage over organic personas with the same attribute score.

A robot with a 3 STR prime and a 17 STR score has a wate allowance of 75 kgs.
Beyond 75 kgs of equipment, the robot will suffer movement penalties like all other personas.
