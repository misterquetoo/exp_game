Mechanics are personas with a deep interest in the inorganic physical world's workings.
The vocation of mechanic encompasses all skills and knowledge of a technical nature, whether electronic, mechanical, structural, etc.
By definition, mechanics are handy personas.
Their skills can range from lasers to sink drains.
Unfortunately, they only have bits and bytes of rudimentary knowledge at their disposal.
Mechanics are exceptionally skilled at identifying artifacts.
This vocation is essential if the expedition expects to repair equipment or create new contraptions.

== Mechanic Abilities
The mechanics have some unique abilities related to their vocation.
An ability is slightly different from a skill.
Every mechanic gets every ability on the list and can use them at any time.
The mechanic could teach another persona one of her skills, but mechanic abilities are for the mechanic persona alone.
The three mechanic abilities are mnemonic trapping, brainstorming and mental patenting.

    range(4, 7): "Memorization",
    range(7, 99): "Replacement",
}


=== Mnemonic Trapping 
Mnemonic trapping allows the mechanic to memorize crucial technical information. 
A mechanic can mnemonically trap dimensions, instructions, serial numbers, or other technical information. 
To memorize important information, the player must win a performance roll.
The degree of difficulty (DD) of the performance roll increases with the information's amount and complexity.
None technical information like people's names or anniversaries is even more difficult to mnemonically trap.
This ability's typical DD range is 1-8 (1d8).

=== Brainstorming
This ability allows the mechanic to solve complex problems by thinking laterally and thinking imaginatively.
Using brainstorming can solve a problem completely, partially, or not at all.
If the brainstorming attempt fails, the persona will most likely postulate a hair-brained idea instead of no idea.
The difficulty (DD) of the performance roll increases with the complexity of the mechanical problem.
Plot points and interpersonal problems are resistant to Brainstorming. 
This ability's typical DD range is 1-20 (1d20).

=== Mental Patenting
The mechanic can memorize a maneuver that she has successfully completed.
Mental patenting allows the mechanic to repeat the maneuver flawlessly.
If the mechanic is upgrading ammo for a mercenary repeatedly, she may want to mentally patent the procedure.
Successful mental patenting will allow her to upgrade the ammo flawlessly in the future.
Mental patented maneuvers do not work with research teams.
Mental patented maneuvers do not earn experience points.
This ability's degree of difficulty is three times the maneuver DD.
To mentally patent a 4DD maneuver requires a DD12 performance roll.

== Mechanic Skills
Mechanic skills are specific areas of expertise, knowledge or aptitude. 
While all mechanics have the abilities above, skills are random and unconnected. 
Mechanic skills vary widely from mechanic to mechanic.

At startup, the mechanic gets one skill for every three points of intelligence score.
A persona with a 16 INT would get five rolls on the Mechanic Skill Table.

.Example Mechanic Skill List
* Chemistry 3
* Detectors 1
* Mending 1

Mechanic skills are cumulative and combinable.
A maneuver that involved chemistry would give the mechanic a skill bonus of +3,
If the maneuver involved chemistry and detectors, her skill bonus would be +4.
If she were mending a broken chemical detector, her skill bonus would be +5.
Skills also support abilities.
If she were trying to mnemonically trap a chemical formula, she would get a bonus of +3.

== Experience
The benefits of increasing experience levels are more skills, improved performance, and somewhat better combat skills. Mechanics earn experience points for completing procedures rolls (80 EXPS per DD) and role-playing within their vocation. Only 20% of combat experience can go towards a mechanic's experience point total.

== Mechanic Maneuvers
Mechanic maneuvers involve anything inorganic or mechanical in nature.
These maneuvers are all about fixing, modifying and creating mechanical devices.
Most mechanic maneuvers are knowledge based and Performance Roll bonuses may reflect this.

A mechanic must have a tool to work with. 
This can be any kind of tool that is not improvised from the persona's body (slap does not equal hammer).
The referee may make a target roll more difficult if the mechanic does not have a tool.
