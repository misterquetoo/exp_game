Veterinarians are the healers of the organic world.
Vets are a combination of doctor, homeopath, surgeon, paramedic, and faith-healer.
They can utilize whatever odds and ends available to assist organic personas in need.
Vets are self-trained and have *not* suffered at a college or school.
They learned from oral histories, experimentation, pamphlets or bits of AV material. 
Their work may be temporary or permanent, incompetent or miraculous.

== Vet Conduct
Veterinarians need the trust of their patients to function.
The therapeutic relationship depends on charisma, trust and skill.
This vocation does not have an oath by any means, but proper conduct makes them better veterinarians.

.*Good Person Good Veterinarian*
* Avoid using weapons that kill or damage life.
* Avoid using violence as a solution unless last resort.
* Make the best choices for their patients

The more the vet strays from these suggested tenets, the harder it will be to heal personas.
It is also possible that a guild or club may take issue with a violent vet.
This conduct is a general goal.
The persona need not be a pacifist or sacrifice their lives senselessly.

== Vet Abilities
Vet abilities are particular aptitudes that a vet can accomplish and other vocations cannot.

Quick Fix::
This ability allows the vet to repair injured personas quickly.
Quick fixes give the patient persona an HPS boost. 
They are most commonly quickly carried out during combat.
The difficulty and during of a quick fix depends on the amount of healing desired.

Subliminal Suggestion::
A veterinarian can pop words into the minds of unsuspecting targets.
The vet can force simple commands such as don't jump, drop it, or stop on the target.
The more reasonable that the suggestion is, the more likely that the subliminal suggestion will succeed.
There is no saving roll for the target if the player wins the performance roll.
The degree of difficulty depends on the target's mental strength.
If the target has a 9 MSTR, the DD of the maneuver is 9.

Paralyzing Pinch::
The vet can render the target unconscious using a dramatic pinch technique.
Willing patients do not require the vet to make an attack roll.
In an unwilling patient, the player must first win an attack roll.
The vet must apply the pinch for 0-2 units (1d3-1), and each unit indicates the player must win another attack roll. 
Only after the successful attack rolls is the performance roll made.
A failed performance roll leaves the target enjoying a harmless shoulder grip.
There is no saving roll for the target if the player wins the performance roll.
The degree of difficulty depends on the target's constitution.
If the target has a 9 CON, the DD of the maneuver is 9.

Death Pinch::
Death Pinch is the deadly version of the paralyzing pinch.
There are no voluntary receivers of this attack.
The vet must apply the pinch for 0-2 units (1d3-1), and each unit indicates the player must win another attack roll. 
Only after the successful attack rolls is the performance roll made.
A failed performance roll leaves the target enjoying a harmless shoulder grip.
The target gets a saving throw versus poison.
The degree of difficulty depends on the target's constitution.
If the target has a 9 CON, the DD of the maneuver is 18.

== Vet Skills
Vet skills are random areas of knowledge picked up during their career.
A vet gets one roll on the Vet Skills Table for every 3 points of intelligence.
The player can extend an existing skill or generate a new one for every new experience level.

A vet with an 18 INT would get six rolls on the skills table. 

.Example Vet Skill List
* Surgery - 2
* Psionics - 2
* Infection - 1
* Aging - 1

A veterinarian can combine her skills into better skill bonuses.
Using the example vet skill list above:
Any surgical procedure would get a skill bonus of +2.
If the surgery is for an infection, the skill bonus would be +3.
If the surgery vs infection on an old persona, the skill bonus would be +4.

== Vet Experience
The benefits of increasing experience levels are more skills, improved performance, and not much else. 
Veterinarians earn experience points for completing maneuvers and role-playing within their vocation.
Only 10% of combat experience can go towards a vet's experience point total.

== Veterinarian Maneuvers
Vet maneuvers involve the healing, repair and enhancement of organic life forms.
Vet maneuvers can be considered Gut or Knowledge maneuvers.
The referee can adjust Performance Roll bonuses depending on where the maneuver lies.

The vet must be able to smile at her patient.
Personal connection is essential equipment for successful veterinarian maneuvers.
The referee may make a target roll more difficult if the vet cannot emotionally connect with her patient.
