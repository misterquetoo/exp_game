== RPG Nerd Pitch

* EXP is a heavily play tested, edited, RPG on its 7th version
* EXP has a history that stretches from a 1970s homebrew to yesterday's git push
* Settle combat with a tactical war game like system or a story based theatrical one
* Persona, vocations, combat, toys and mythos are integrated
* EXP employs xref:roll_playing_system:kilo_die_mechanic.adoc[the kilodie mechanic], a practical d1000 roll, to create highly granular outcomes, or not
* Randomly generate fleshed out personas with dice rolls galore, or not
* Resolve combat or tasks with roll over mechanics, or not
* The ruleset is resilient and detail can be easily shed without collapsing playability
